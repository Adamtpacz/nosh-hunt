# Nosh Hunt

**Nosh Hunt** is a restaurant tracking app that allows you to add restaurants to user generated lists and categorize the lists based on attributes such as type of cuisine, price range, and location. 

Users have the ability to create, update and delete curated lists of restaurants as well as sign up for the service and log into their account to only see the lists that they have created.
